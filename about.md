# VizFin: Visualizing Finance

# (Better name to follow...)

This is a small site created to host a few finance-focused visualizations I created.

The project is the direct result of struggling with some elements of the CFA. As a visual thinker, I often found it much easier to grasp a concept once I had a clear visualization of its functionality. Easier than memorizing a bunch of formulas!
